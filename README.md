# ðŸŒŽ ClimateVector

**ClimateVector** is a web application made to help people understand Earthâ€™s climate change (also known as global warming).  
It shows how greenhouse gases have increased; mostly because of human activities and the results, like temperature rise, ice melting, and ocean mass changes.

## What It Does
 
- Displays data from when it was first recorded up to now for all factors 
- Uses charts and cards to show data clearly  
- Shows the growth rate of greenhouse gases like COâ‚‚, CHâ‚„, Nâ‚‚O, and SFâ‚†  
- Tracks ice mass loss in Antarctica and Greenland, and ocean mass changes   
- Lets users select year range and factor (like COâ‚‚ or CHâ‚„) to explore trends  
- Shows air quality of user's location or searched city using coordinates or city name  

## Tech Used

- React â€“ building the UI  
- React Router â€“ for routing  
- recharts â€“ for all charts  
- Lucide Icons â€“ for nice-looking icons  
- OpenWeather API â€“ for air quality data  
- ClimateMonitor API â€“ for all climate-related data  

## Data Sources

- [ClimateMonitor API](https://climatemonitor.info/api/public/v1) â€“ for COâ‚‚, CHâ‚„, Nâ‚‚O, SFâ‚† levels, temperature anomalies, glacier and ocean mass loss  
- [OpenWeather Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) â€“ for air quality by coordinates or city name

This app is still improving, more features and visuals will be added over time.
